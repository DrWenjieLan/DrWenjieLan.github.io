  [patent] Wenjie Lan. 2024. An Optimized Position Management Method and System. CN118799048A, filed July 26, 2024, and published October 18, 2024.   
  The present invention relates to the technical field of position management, and in particular to an optimal position management method and system, comprising a service end, a management end, and a transaction end. The service end comprises a data acquisition module, an indicator processing module, a transaction strategy generation module, a sending module, a processing module, and a real-time monitoring module. The sending module sends the generated optimal transaction strategy to the management end, which approves it, generates corresponding approval information, and returns it to the service end. The processing module identifies the approval information and approved optimal transaction strategy, sending the strategy to the transaction end, which executes corresponding transactions. The real-time monitoring module monitors the transaction operations in real time and issues an alarm if any irrational operations are detected.



# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This invention provides an optimal position management system comprising service, management, and transaction ends, enabling real-time strategy generation, approval, execution, and monitoring to ensure efficient and secure transaction operations with alarm mechanisms for irregularities.
