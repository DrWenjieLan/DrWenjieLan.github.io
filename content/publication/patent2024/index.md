abstract:  [patent] Wenjie Lan. 2024. An Optimized Position Management Method and System. CN118799048A, filed July 26,2024, and published October 18 2024  \n       
The present invention relates to the technical field of position management, and in particular to an optimal position management method and system, comprising a service end, a management end, and a transaction end; the service end comprises a data acquisition module, an indicator processing module, a transaction strategy generation module, a sending module, a processing module, and a real-time monitoring module; the sending module sends the generated optimal transaction strategy to the management end, and the management end is used to approve the received optimal transaction strategy, generate corresponding approval information and send it to the service end; the processing module is used to identify the received approval information, identify the approved optimal transaction strategy and send the corresponding optimal transaction strategy to the transaction end; the transaction end is used to perform corresponding transaction operations according to the received optimal transaction strategy; the real-time monitoring module is used to monitor and judge the transaction operation in real time, judge whether the transaction operation is unreasonable, and if so, generate a corresponding alarm signal and send it to the transaction end.   


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This invention provides an optimal position management system comprising service, management, and transaction ends, enabling real-time strategy generation, approval, execution, and monitoring to ensure efficient and secure transaction operations with alarm mechanisms for irregularities.
