abstract: This paper distinguishes between risk resonance and risk diversification relationships in the cryptocurrency market based on the newly developed asymmetric breakpoint approach, and analyzes the risk propagation mechanism among cryptocurrencies under extreme events. In addition, through the lens of node association and network structure, this paper explores the dynamic evolutionary relationship of cryptocurrency risk association before and after the epidemic. In addition, the driving mechanism of the cryptocurrency risk movement is analyzed in a depth with the epidemic indicators. The findings show that the effect of propagation of risk among cryptocurrencies becomes more significant under the influence of the new crown outbreak. At the same time, the increase in the number of confirmed cases exacerbated the risk spillover effect among cryptocurrencies, while the risk resonance effect that exists between the crude oil market and the cryptocurrency market amplified the extent of the outbreak's impact on cryptocurrencies. However, other financial markets are relatively independent of the cryptocurrency market. This study proposes a strategy to deal with the spread of cryptocurrency risks from the perspective of a public health crisis, providing a useful reference basis for improving the regulatory mechanism of cryptocurrencies.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper employs an asymmetric breakpoint approach to analyze the dynamic risk propagation and resonance mechanisms in the cryptocurrency market during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the amplified spillover effects driven by epidemic indicators and their implications for regulatory strategies.
