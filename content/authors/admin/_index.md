    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

**Wenjie Lan** is a Master of Science student in Statistics at Duke University. She holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Financial Technology from the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics. Wenjie's academic and research interests span Bayesian time series analysis, the Bayes-Nash Equilibrium (integrating Bayesian methodology and game theory), and data privacy.

During her undergraduate studies, Wenjie conducted research across two primary tracks. The first focused on applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to assess and predict risk, including credit risk, the probability of financial distress in institutions, and statistical measures such as CoES to identify systemic risks among entities. The second track was more diverse, where she leveraged advanced methodologies to tackle complex problems encountered during internships and project work. Key projects include optimizing bank position management using advanced optimization methods (2023), fine-tuning the FinBERT model for sentiment classification in the stock market (2022), constructing high-frequency factors with signal processing techniques (2024), and developing data privacy solutions for large language models (LLMs) in finance (2024‚Äìpresent).
